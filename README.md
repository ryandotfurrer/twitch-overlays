# Astro & Tailwind Starter

Edit `src/pages/index.astro` to get started.

## More about this starter

I created this started solely for myself to have a better and faster jumping off point on new NextJS projects. While it _largely_ un-opinionated, that does not mean there are zero opinions.

This starter template _may_ grow a bit with styles and components that match my desired style. You can, of course, change whatever you would like in the appropriate folders. But to begin with this starter features:

- Responsive font-sizing
- Responsive element spacing due to the addition of the .flow class
- Poppins Google Font added to Tailwinds `fontSans` class
- Basic light and dark mode

## The `.flow` Class

Here is a quick breakdown of the `.flow` class:

1. Help manage flow and rhythm of elements.
2. Every direct sibling child element of has margin-block-start added to it.
3. Uses 1em as a fallback from clamp syntax.
